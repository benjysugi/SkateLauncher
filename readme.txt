This is the first open source release of Leakorama (formerly SK8Warehouse)'s launcher for the Skate playtests

This is an early beta that was never finished. If you want to finish it or add extra features, feel free to submit a pull request
We never got round to the UI redesign that was planned, though we may eventually.

This release is the unfinished v1.1.2 Beta 5.
